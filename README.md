#Josh Brischke Individual Project

##For the last 20 years I have been around gaming and played many different types of games, one thing I have noticed is how inaccurate most company reviews are because they are either bought, favored or flooded. My goal is to create a site that allow users to logon with two factor authentication so that it cannot be flooded and allow public users to rate here own experience that are recorded and show publically.
