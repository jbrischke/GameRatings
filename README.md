# Problem Statement

## For the last 20 years I have been around gaming and played many different types of games, one thing I have noticed is how inaccurate most company reviews are because they are either bought, favored or flooded. My goal is to create a site that allow users to logon and allow users to rate their own experience that are recorded and shown publically.
